This project is in the works. Under development, one might say.

It "works". Not that well at the current time.

For 6 audio channels, the latency can be a problem. 

It does peak detection at 3.9ms latency. Not bad! 

It does frequency detection at 66.0ms latency. Bad. That's 14 maybe 15 times a second. 

Maybe my test was wrong, but I'll be working on making that number better for sure.
