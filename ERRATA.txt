For some reason, with arduino-1.8.10 and teensyduino 1.49 beta 2, the thing failed to compile.
To fix this, i had to add variables to some .c source:

Variables added:

----
#define CDC_RX_SIZE_480       512
#define CDC_RX_SIZE_12        64
#define CDC_TX_SIZE_480       512
#define CDC_TX_SIZE_12        64
----

The files variables were added to:

----
arduino-1.8.10/hardware/teensy/avr/cores/teensy4/usb_serial.c
arduino-1.8.10/hardware/teensy/avr/cores/teensy4/usb_desc.c
----

The variables were defined in usb_desc.h but were not picked up properly for some reason
